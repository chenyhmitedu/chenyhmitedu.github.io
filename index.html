    <h1 style="text-align: center">Workshop for economic modeling in Julia</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center">Y.-H. Henry Chen</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px">
      As an open-source programming language, Julia is getting popular in scientific computing, in part due to its nonproprietary nature, 
      speed potential and extensive packages for applications. The goal of this workshop is to provide CS3 researchers interested in exploring 
      Julia an introduction to economic modeling using Julia. <br><br> 
      
      The workshop will begin from Julia basics, and then introduce computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling using Julia. For CGE modeling in Julia, 
      I will borrow examples presented in <a href="https://www.mpsge.org/tutorial.pdf"> James Markusen’s CGE course </a> and convert those examples 
      into Julia versions, so that participants get an idea about how to do similar exercises on their own. Other topic such as data processing in 
      Julia may be covered if any interest. <br><br>
      
      The workshop will include four online one-hour meetings, one meeting per month for four months with possible future extension. The plan is to hold the 
      first meeting in January, 2026.
