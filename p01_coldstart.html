      According to Google Gemini, when using the BenchmarkTools.jl to produce many runs (e.g., 1000 runs) for the purpose of measuring solving time, 
      "BenchmarkTools often runs its samples in a way that prevents the previous sample's solution state from carrying over." 
      To speed up the solve with a policy shock, one may solve the model to find the solution before using the BenchmarkTools. Now, the subsequent
      solves conducted by BenchmarkTools will be using the aforementioned solution as the reference point, therefore avoid being in a cold-state,
      where no prior solution can be referred to for saving time. <a href="https://chenyhmitedu.github.io"> Back to homepage. </a>
